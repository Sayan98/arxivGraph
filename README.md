# what?
Discover and find connects between AI/ML researchers

# why?
AI/ML has been evolving at an astonishing rate and keepin up with a progress for someone who's new to the field is hard. arXivGraph tries to be an aid to you by letting you know the prominent figures in research, their collaborators and more.

# how?
arXivGraph works by scrapping data from arXiv(duh!). arXiv however doesn't include citation data and getting that would be the logical next step.
